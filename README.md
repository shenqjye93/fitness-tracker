# My Web App Journey: From Zero to ???

## Introduction

- [x] **Purpose:** This web app is a combination of two important features. Firstly, I am an avid Ultimate Frisbee player, so being able to log my workout would keep me accountable as a player. Secondly, as parents grew older they are required to log their blood pressure (bp) and blood glucose level, so I thought to create a web app so that they can log the details and be able to see a visual representation of their levels.

- [x] **Background:** I started off in University as a Mechanical Engineering student. Had Introduction to Programming where I learnt basic data structure and algorithms in C++. Upon graduating, I did not pursue engineering profession and instead, got into teaching. Meanwhile, I was also a part time online tutor - teaching scratch and python to kids and teens, this is where my passion for programming grew. After teaching for 5 years, here I am looking to upskill and break into tech industry.

## Getting Started

- [x] **Initial Challenges:** I have always been intimidated by the vastness of programming. With countless languages and each with their own syntax and rules, it had always been a huge obstacle for me, perhaps was stuck deeply with decision paralysis.

- [x] **Resources and Tools:** - My friend Jian Shen, for pointing me into the right directions and resources to kick start my project, as well as providing me insights and encouragement to finish my project. - FastAPI tutorial documentation - Windows Subsystem for Linux to be able to code in Linux environmnet - Visual Studio Code as my main IDE for this project - PrimeAgent "Last Data Structure and Algorithms Course" to understand more about DSA - Google Data Analysis Course for SQL

## Learning the Tools

- [?] **Programming Languages:** I have learnt some Data Structures and Algorithms back in Uni days with C#, thus it was easier to take up some of the programming logics. I currently teach Python to teens, so that has helped me to be able to build my backend using python. That being said, knowing basic Python syntax is just the tip of the iceberg for me, as there are still so much more that I learn while building my project. For the frontend components HTML, CSS and JS primarily via youtube tutorials, documentations and then using AI to help me improve and understand my code better. Finally, I did also learn SQL early on in my teaching career as well as taking up the Google Data Analysis Certificate course which definitely helped my understanding of databases.

- [?] **Frameworks and Libraries:** To build my web app, I mainly used vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript for frontend, Python and FastAPI for backend and SQLite as my database. As for FastAPI framework, getting familiar with the tutorial documentation was very helpful. In FastAPI, I first learnt how to create different endpoints for my backend. Using the CRUD method, I was able to learn and apply the Get, Post, Put, and Delete method. As for JavaScript, I meddled with ChartJs to create interesting visuals for my dashboard.

- [x] **Version Control:** My experience with Git was a memorable one. After deploying my web app on Render, I played around my code, trying to add a user feature as an update - all this in the master branch. After a few commits, my app broke and I have no idea where the code base started to break. Thankfully, through Git i was able to revert my code base back to when my app still works. Now, I will always remember to test out features in a feature branch.

Using Git and GitHub was also interesting as branching allows me to see the changes that I made and compare my code with the previous or master branch before merging.

## Building the Web App

- [ ] **Project Planning:** How you planned the architecture and user experience.
      wireframing, excalidraw,
- [ ] **Development Process:** Step-by-step recount of your development phases.
      deployment
- [ ] **Problem-Solving:** Describe major challenges and how you overcame them.

## Reflections and Lessons Learned

- [ ] **Key Takeaways:** What skills and insights you gained.
- [ ] **Future Improvements:** Here are a bucketlist of updates that I plan to implement: - [ ] Allowing users to save their favourite exercises or workouts - [ ] Improving responsiveness of my dashboard to allow access in various views

## Conclusion

- [ ] **Final Thoughts:** I hope that this journey into software development would be a great one. To be very honest, I am terrified but at the same time incredibly excited about my project.
