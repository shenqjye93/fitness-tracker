# My Web App Journey: From Zero to ???

## Introduction

- [x]**Purpose:** This web app is a combination of two important features. Firstly, I am an avid Ultimate Frisbee player, so being able to log my workout would keep me accountable as a player. Secondly, as parents grew older they are required to log their blood pressure (bp) and blood glucose level, so I thought to create a web app so that they can log the details and be able to see a visual representation of their levels.

- [x]**Background:** I started off in University as a Mechanical Engineering student. Had Introduction to Programming where I learnt basic data structure and algorithms in C++. Upon graduating, I did not pursue engineering profession and instead, got into teaching. Meanwhile, I was also a part time online tutor - teaching scratch and python to kids and teens, this is where my passion for programming grew. After teaching for 5 years, here I am looking to upskill and break into tech industry.
