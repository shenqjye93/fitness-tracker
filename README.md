# My Web App Journey: From Zero to ???

## Introduction

- [x] **Purpose:** This web app is a combination of two important features. Firstly, I am an avid Ultimate Frisbee player, so being able to log my workout would keep me accountable as a player. Secondly, as parents grew older they are required to log their blood pressure (bp) and blood glucose level, so I thought to create a web app so that they can log the details and be able to see a visual representation of their levels.

- [x] **Background:** I started off in University as a Mechanical Engineering student. Had Introduction to Programming where I learnt basic data structure and algorithms in C++. Upon graduating, I did not pursue engineering profession and instead, got into teaching. Meanwhile, I was also a part time online tutor - teaching scratch and python to kids and teens, this is where my passion for programming grew. After teaching for 5 years, here I am looking to upskill and break into tech industry.

## Getting Started

- [x] **Initial Challenges:** I have always been intimidated by the vastness of programming. With countless languages and each with their own syntax and rules, it had always been a huge obstacle for me.

- [ ] **Resources and Tools:** List tutorials, courses, books, or mentors that helped. FastAPI tutorial

## Learning the Tools

- [ ] **Programming Languages:** How you learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.
- [ ] **Frameworks and Libraries:** To build my web app, I mainly used vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript for frontend, Python and FastAPI for backend and SQLite as my database.
      talk about , routing, path parameters, basemodel, methods (get, post, put, delete)
- [x] **Version Control:** My experience with Git was a memorable one. After deploying my web app on Render, I played around my code, trying to add a user feature as an update - all this in the master branch. After a few commits, my app broke and I have no idea where the code base started to break. Thankfully, through Git i was able to revert my code base back to when my app still works. Now, I will always remember to test out features in a feature branch.

Using Git and GitHub was also interesting as branching allows me to see the changes that I made and compare my code with the previous or master branch before merging.

## Building the Web App

- [ ] **Project Planning:** How you planned the architecture and user experience.
      wireframing, excalidraw
- [ ] **Development Process:** Step-by-step recount of your development phases.
      deployment
- [ ] **Problem-Solving:** Describe major challenges and how you overcame them.

## Reflections and Lessons Learned

- [ ] **Key Takeaways:** What skills and insights you gained.
- [ ] **Future Improvements:** What you plan to learn or enhance in your project.
      user management
      saving favourite exercises / workouts
      responsiveness

## Conclusion

- [ ] **Final Thoughts:** A summary of your journey and encouragement for others starting out.
